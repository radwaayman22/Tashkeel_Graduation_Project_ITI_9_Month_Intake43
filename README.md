# Tashkeel_Graduation_Project_ITI_9_Month_Intake43

Tashkeel is an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on enhancing Arabic text by accurately adding diacritical marks, commonly known as "harakat," to indicate correct pronunciation.

## Project Overview

The Tashkeel project involves the following main components:

- Development of an advanced diacritization model for Arabic text using a CNN-LSTM architecture.
- Implementation of a rule-based correction model to enhance diacritization accuracy and ensure high-quality output.
- Deployment of the developed model as a FastAPI application for easy integration and usage.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Hugging Face's Tashkeela Clean Version, which provides high-quality Arabic text with diacritics. You can find the dataset at the following link: [Tashkeela Clean Version Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/arbml/tashkeelav2).

## Model 
The structure of the baseline model. It consists of an embedding layer of 64 dimensions, followed by two bidirectional LSTM layers, each consisting of 64 cells, then a fully connected layer to project to the output size, and lastly, a softmax layer to output the probability for each diacritic.
